### DevOps - Infrastructure & Configuration Management - November 2022

The main goal of the course is to introduce some of the most commonly used tools that underpin most DevOps practices. The course will introduce tools for creating and managing infrastructure through code and configuration management and provisioning. Popular and common tools in DevOps practices are selected. An introduction to each of these will be given, including theory and practice, and then placed in a general context with the technologies already discussed.
